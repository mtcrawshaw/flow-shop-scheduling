Road Map:
--> Weekly schedule of tasks
    Weekly goals
    Trello-like board/calendar for tasks/events
    Longer term goal integration
    Analytics
    Automatic scheduling
    Website
    Mobile app
    Watch app

Current sprint (Weekly schedule of tasks):
    Task/Schedule classes
    Schedule editing with ScheduleSession
--> Runner to interact with session via terminal
    Dump schedule to google drive
    Refactoring

Current task (Runner to interact with session via terminal):
    TerminalSession skeleton
    main.py (Loads a session if one is given, otherwise starts a new one)
    Display session
--> Navigate by character with h, j, k, l
    Navigate by task instead of by character (highlight selected box)
    Navigate by day with {/}
    Edit task: Enter edit mode with e, arrow keys and tab/Shift+tab to change fields, Enter to submit
    Insert/append task: i/a to put task before/after, then goes into edit mode
    Delete task: d (D to delete and move other tasks back to fill space)
    Move task(s): v to enter move mode, j/k to highlight tasks to move, Enter once, type number of hours, Enter to submit
    Undo/redo: u, r
    Advance week: n to go forward and N to go back
    Save: Ctrl-s
    Quit: Ctrl-q
    Load: Ctrl-l
    New: Ctrl-n
    Refactoring

Notes for current task:
Add tests for Session.num_tasks()?

Refactoring:
- Change background color and text colors
- Always have field names in first row
- Handle task names that are too long

Next time: Start navigation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before merging to master:
- Lint with ``black flowshop``
- Fix typing issues with ``mypy flowshop``
- Maximize pylint score with ``pylint flowshop``
- Make sure all tests pass with ``pytest tests``

Refactoring:
- Use class to access .planned and .actual instead of having tuple of planned, actual
  and using session.edit_history[0]/session.edit_history[1].
- Rewrite Schedule.tasks_in_interval() to use binary search instead of linear search
  (tasks are sorted by time!).
- Make session.current_schedules() a property.

Future additions:
- Command to "swap" a task: Highlight a task, press "swap" key, then when cursor moves
  the task moves with it, with other tasks sliding in to fill the space left behind.
